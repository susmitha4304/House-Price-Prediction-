 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
 Project Overview :
This project is a supervised machine learning model designed to predict house sale prices based on key features such as living area, overall quality, year built, and garage capacity. The dataset used is derived from the Kaggle House Prices competition and is processed using Python and Scikit-Learn.The goal is to demonstrate the ability to build a regression model, evaluate its performance, and interpret the outputs for meaningful business insights.

 Tools & Technologies :
 Python Pandas, NumPy – data manipulation and analysis
 Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization
 Scikit-Learn – machine learning modeling and evaluation
 Jupyter Notebook / .py script – development environment

 Features Used :
GrLivArea: Above ground living area (in square feet)
OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality
YearBuilt: Original construction date
GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity

 Machine Learning Model :
Model Used: Linear Regression
Evaluation Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Cross-Validation (R² with 5 folds)

Results Summary :
R² Score: ~0.70 - 0.80 depending on the train-test split
Residual plots and distribution analysis indicate a reasonably good model fit
